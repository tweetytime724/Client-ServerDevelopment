# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The best way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to leave commits in the code stating what that part of the code is suppose to do. You can also make sure there is plenty of white space to space out each portion of the code. The advantage of having connecting the Python CRUD program to create the dashboard is so you can simply keep different programs seperate and clean.
