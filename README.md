# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The best way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to leave commits in the code stating what that part of the code is suppose to do. You can also make sure there is plenty of white space to space out each portion of the code. The advantage of having connecting the Python CRUD program to create the dashboard is so you can simply keep different programs seperate and clean.


# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The best approach that I know works well is to take one step at a time. Doing research helps figure out how to meet standards and requests from the client. This approach does not differ from other assignments from other courses; work on one part of a big project at a time. I think in the future the strategy I should use is to ask more questions when something does not work in my favor, more specifically, ask a more knowledgeable computer software person and in a more timely manner. 


# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do a lot with computers, they deal with all sorts of programming and fixing problems. This project of creating a database for a company like Grazioso Salvare fixes the problem of accessing and changing the database easier. When fixing a problem, it does not mean fixing an existing program all the time, computer scientists fix problems for companies by creating programs to make the lives of the people at the companies easier.
